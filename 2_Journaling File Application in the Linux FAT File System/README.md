Journaling File Application in the Linux FAT File System

In this project the Linux kernel source code was provided in the form of a library. By linking this library with an application, it became possible to run the Linux kernel at the user level. For this exercise, the task involved extending the FAT file system within the Linux kernel library to introduce a journaling feature. This journaling functionality recorded all modifications made to the file system during the execution of applications, providing a comprehensive log of changes.
